cargo run 100

This command tells the program to capture 100 packets and save them to capture.pcap 

in the captured_packets directory within your project.

The directory will be auto-created while capturing the packets. 

You can set your own numbers at your own risk.

Afterward you can just fire up WireShark and have a look at the gathered packets.
